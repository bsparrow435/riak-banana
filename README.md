Riak2.0 + LucidWorks/banana

#### Status: WIP

##### Issues:
- dashboards should be stored in Riak
- actual entry values should be pulled from Riak instead of Solr
- break out riak, riakbanana, and java modules
- add example multi-node deployment
- add how-to without vagrant
- add OS tunings
- ~~nginx & logstash need to be restarted appropriately via puppet~~
- ~~hacky librarian-puppet issues due to windows /vagrant mounts should be worked around~~
- ~~race condition during 'vagrant up', need to run 'vagrant provision' after~~
- ~~uses ugly 'files' directory, referencing "/vagrant/files" in puppet modules, need to clean up~~
- ~~hitting local solr instead of Riak solr query interface, due to Banana requesting Solr Admin API calls~~

#### Notes
The

The goal is to hook in LucidWorks/banana into Riak2.0's solr interface, use Riak to store dashboards, etc, and riak to submit log data.

Currently Functional, needs cleaning/testing
